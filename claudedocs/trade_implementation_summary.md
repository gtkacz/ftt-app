## 📊 Trade Flow Implementation

### Creating a Trade
1. Navigate to `/trades/create`
2. Select teams to include (minimum 2)
3. Add assets for each team:
   - Players with contract details
   - Draft picks with optional protection
4. Real-time validation shows cap/roster impact
5. Save as draft or propose immediately

### Responding to a Trade
1. View in Trade Inbox (pending badge)
2. Click to see full details
3. Review assets and team impacts
4. Accept, Reject, or Counter offer
5. Optional message with response

### Trade Status Workflow
```
draft → proposed → accepted → waiting_approval → approved → completed
  ↓         ↓          ↓              ↓               ↓
cancelled rejected  vetoed        vetoed         vetoed
```

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### State Management (Pinia)
```typescript
// Draft trade composition
draftTrade: {
  proposing_team: number | null
  teams: number[]
  assets: CreateTradeAssetData[]
  notes: string
}

// Validation state
validationResult: TradeValidationResponse | null
isValidating: boolean

// Trade lists
activeTrades: Trade[]
sentTrades: Trade[]
tradeHistory: Trade[]
```

### API Integration
All API calls go through `TradeService`:
- CRUD operations for trades
- Asset management (add/remove/update)
- Offer responses (accept/reject/counter)
- Pick management
- Validation endpoint
- Commissioner actions

### Type Safety
Full TypeScript coverage with:
- Trade, TradeOffer, TradeAsset models
- Pick protection types
- Validation response types
- Team impact calculations
- Discriminated unions for status

## 🎯 Next Steps / Future Enhancements

## 🐛 Known Limitations

1. **Player/Pick Selection**: Currently shows placeholders - needs full selector implementation
2. **Contract Integration**: Needs connection to contract/player API endpoints
3. **Notifications**: Basic structure in place, needs WebSocket/polling implementation
4. **Trade History**: Pagination not implemented yet
5. **Mobile UX**: Desktop-first, mobile needs optimization

## 🔗 Integration Points

### Required Backend Endpoints
Make sure these endpoints exist in your Django backend:

```

POST   /api/trades/                    # Create trade
GET    /api/trades/:id/                # Get trade details
PATCH  /api/trades/:id/                # Update trade
DELETE /api/trades/:id/                # Delete trade
POST   /api/trades/:id/propose/        # Propose trade

## 💡 Usage Examples

### Creating a Simple 2-Team Trade
```typescript
// User navigates to /trades/create
// Select Team B
// Add Player A (Team A → Team B)
// Add Player B (Team B → Team A)
// System validates salary caps
// Click "Propose Trade"
```

### Creating Trade with Protected Pick
```typescript
// In trade composer
// Add pick: "2025 1st Round (via LAL)"
// Click pick to configure protection
// Select "Doesn't Convey"
// Set range: 1-5 (Top-5 protected)
// Set rollover: 2026
// Save - shows "🛡️ Top-5 Protected" badge
```

### Responding to Trade
```typescript
// Notification badge shows pending trade
// Click trade in inbox
// Review assets and impacts
// See: "You're getting Player X, giving Pick Y"
// Click "Accept Trade"
// Optionally add message
// Trade moves to waiting_approval
```
