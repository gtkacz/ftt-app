# Frontend Implementation Prompt: Trade & Pick Protection System

## Context

A Django-based fantasy basketball league application has just implemented a comprehensive trade and pick protection system. You need to build the complete frontend UI/UX for this system. The backend provides REST API endpoints for all trade operations.

## Backend Models Overview

### 1. Trade Model
**Purpose**: Main container for multi-team trades

**Key Fields**:
- `proposing_team`: Team that initiated the trade
- `teams`: ManyToMany - all teams involved (2+)
- `status`: draft | proposed | accepted | rejected | cancelled | waiting_approval | approved | completed | vetoed
- `notes`: Optional trade notes
- Timestamps: `created_at`, `proposed_at`, `completed_at`, `approved_at`
- `approved_by`: Commissioner who approved (ForeignKey to User)

**Status Workflow**:
```
draft ‚Üí proposed ‚Üí accepted ‚Üí (waiting_approval) ‚Üí approved ‚Üí completed
           ‚Üì           ‚Üì              ‚Üì                ‚Üì
       cancelled   rejected        vetoed          vetoed
```

### 2. TradeOffer Model
**Purpose**: Track each team's response to a trade

**Key Fields**:
- `trade`: ForeignKey to Trade
- `team`: Team making the response
- `status`: pending | accepted | rejected | countered
- `is_proposer`: Boolean - whether this team proposed
- `counter_offer`: Self-referencing FK - links to original offer if this is a counter
- `message`: Optional message with response
- `responded_at`: When team responded

### 3. TradeAsset Model
**Purpose**: Individual assets (players/picks) being traded

**Key Fields**:
- `trade`: ForeignKey to Trade
- `asset_type`: "player" | "pick"
- `giving_team`: Team giving up asset
- `receiving_team`: Team receiving asset
- `player`: ForeignKey to Player (if asset_type="player")
- `pick`: ForeignKey to Pick (if asset_type="pick")

**Pick Protection Fields** (only for picks):
- `pick_protection_type`: "none" | "swap_best" | "swap_worst" | "doesnt_convey"
- `pick_protection_range_start`: Integer (1-30)
- `pick_protection_range_end`: Integer (1-30)
- `pick_swap_target`: ForeignKey to another Pick
- `pick_rollover_year`: Integer (year)

### 4. Pick Model
**Purpose**: Draft capital/assets teams own

**Key Fields**:
- `original_team`: Team that originally owned pick
- `current_team`: Team that currently owns pick
- `draft_year`: Year of draft
- `round_number`: Round number
- `protection_type`: "none" | "swap_best" | "swap_worst" | "doesnt_convey"
- `protection_range_start/end`: For doesnt_convey protections
- `swap_target_pick`: Pick to swap with
- `rollover_year`: Year to roll to if doesn't convey
- `actual_pick_number`: Actual position (1-30) after lottery
- `is_conveyed`: Whether pick transferred or was protected

## Pick Protection Logic

### Protection Types Explained

**1. No Protection (`none`)**
- Pick transfers normally with no conditions

**2. Swap if Best (`swap_best`)**
- If this pick ends up better (lower number) than the swap target, the teams swap picks
- Example: Team A trades their 2025 1st with swap_best protection vs Team B's 2025 1st
  - If Team A gets pick #3 and Team B gets pick #15, they swap ‚Üí Team A keeps #15, Team B gets #3

**3. Swap if Worst (`swap_worst`)**
- If this pick ends up worse (higher number) than the swap target, the teams swap picks
- Example: Same scenario, Team A would get the worse pick, Team B the better

**4. Doesn't Convey (`doesnt_convey`)**
- If pick falls in protected range, it doesn't transfer and rolls over to future year
- Example: Top-5 protected (range 1-5), rolls to 2026
  - If pick is #3 ‚Üí doesn't convey, original team keeps it, new pick created for 2026
  - If pick is #12 ‚Üí conveys normally to receiving team

## Business Rules & Validation

### Trade Validation Rules

1. **Salary Cap Compliance**
   - Calculate net salary change per team: (incoming salary - outgoing salary)
   - `team.total_salary() + net_salary <= LEAGUE_SETTINGS.SALARY_CAP`
   - Display current salary, net change, and remaining cap space

2. **Player Cap Compliance**
   - Calculate net player change: (incoming players - outgoing players)
   - `team.total_players() + net_players <= LEAGUE_SETTINGS.MAX_PLAYER_CAP`
   - Display current roster size, net change, and remaining slots

3. **RFA Player Trading**
   - Players with 0 contract years remaining can ONLY be traded if they have `is_rfa=True`
   - Validate that giving_team owns the RFA rights
   - Display RFA status clearly in player cards

4. **Pick Ownership**
   - Only current_team can trade a pick
   - Validate pick hasn't already been traded in this draft year
   - Show pick history (original owner ‚Üí current owner)

5. **Multi-Team Trades**
   - Minimum 2 teams, no maximum
   - Each team must give AND receive at least one asset (no "salary dumps")
   - All teams must accept before trade can be approved

### Pick Protection Validation

1. **Swap Protections** (swap_best, swap_worst)
   - Must specify `swap_target_pick`
   - Target must be from same draft year and round
   - Cannot swap pick with itself
   - Both picks must exist and be owned by trading teams

2. **Doesn't Convey Protection**
   - Must specify `protection_range_start` and `protection_range_end`
   - Range start must be ‚â§ range end
   - Must specify `rollover_year` (must be > draft_year)
   - Clearly explain: "If pick falls between #X-#Y, it stays with original team and new pick created for [rollover_year]"

## User Workflows

### Workflow 1: Simple 2-Team Trade

1. User navigates to "Create Trade" or "Trade Center"
2. Select second team from dropdown
3. **Add Assets**:
   - From my team ‚Üí their team: Player A ($10M)
   - From their team ‚Üí my team: Player B ($8M)
4. Review impact: My salary goes down $2M, still under cap ‚úÖ
5. Add note: "Let's make this happen!"
6. Click "Propose Trade"
7. Other team receives notification
8. Other team reviews, clicks "Accept"
9. Trade status ‚Üí "accepted"
10. Commissioner (or auto if enabled) approves
11. Trade executes: contracts updated

### Workflow 2: 3-Team Trade with Protected Pick

1. User creates trade, adds Team B and Team C
2. **Add Assets**:
   - Team A ‚Üí Team B: Player X ($12M)
   - Team B ‚Üí Team C: 2025 1st Round pick (top-5 protected, rolls to 2026)
   - Team C ‚Üí Team A: Player Y ($10M), 2026 2nd Round pick
3. **Configure Pick Protection**:
   - Click on 2025 1st pick
   - Select "Doesn't Convey"
   - Set range: 1-5
   - Set rollover: 2026
   - Save ‚Üí Badge shows "üõ°Ô∏è Top-5 protected"
4. Validate: All teams under cap ‚úÖ
5. Propose trade
6. Team B and Team C receive notifications
7. Team B accepts
8. Team C rejects with message: "Not enough value"
9. Team A receives rejection notification
10. Team A creates counter-offer with modified assets

### Workflow 3: Pick Swap Protection

1. Team A has Brooklyn's 2025 1st (unprotected)
2. Team A trades for Team B's 2025 1st with swap protection
3. **Configure Swap**:
   - Add Team B's 2025 1st to trade
   - Protection type: "Swap if Best"
   - Swap target: Brooklyn's 2025 1st (owned by Team A)
4. Explanation shows: "If Team B's pick is better than Brooklyn's pick, they swap"
5. Trade executes
6. At draft time (before draft starts):
   - Brooklyn gets #3 pick
   - Team B gets #15 pick
   - Protection NOT triggered (15 > 3, so no swap)
   - Team A receives #15 pick as traded
7. Alternative scenario:
   - Brooklyn gets #15 pick
   - Team B gets #3 pick
   - Protection TRIGGERED (3 < 15, swap!)
   - Team A receives #15 pick (swapped)
   - Team B keeps #3 pick

## Technical Requirements

### Framework/Stack
- Use the existing frontend framework (React/Vue/Angular/Svelte)
- Match existing design system and component patterns
- Responsive design (mobile, tablet, desktop)
- Accessibility: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance

### State Management
- Handle complex trade state (draft, assets, validations)
- Real-time updates for trade status changes
- Optimistic UI updates with rollback on error
- Cache invalidation when trades execute

### Performance
- Lazy load trade history (pagination/infinite scroll)
- Debounce validation API calls
- Optimize asset list rendering (virtualization if needed)
- Minimize re-renders during trade composition

### Error Handling
- Network errors with retry logic
- Validation errors with specific field highlighting
- Optimistic update failures with user notification
- Concurrent modification handling (trade changed while viewing)

### Testing
- Unit tests for validation logic
- Integration tests for trade workflows
- E2E tests for critical paths (create, propose, accept, execute)
- Visual regression tests for complex components

## Design Considerations

### UX Principles
- **Clarity**: Every asset, protection, and impact must be crystal clear
- **Confidence**: Users must understand exactly what they're agreeing to
- **Reversibility**: Draft trades can be edited; proposed trades can be withdrawn
- **Feedback**: Immediate validation feedback, no surprises
- **Guidance**: Tooltips, help text, examples for complex concepts

### Visual Hierarchy
- **Primary**: Trade status, my response actions
- **Secondary**: Asset lists, impact analysis
- **Tertiary**: Notes, timestamps, history

### Color Coding
- **Green**: Under cap, beneficial changes, accepted
- **Red**: Over cap, violations, rejected
- **Yellow**: Warnings, pending responses
- **Blue**: Info, neutral changes
- **Gray**: Completed, historical

### Mobile Optimization
- Simplified trade creation flow (step-by-step wizard)
- Collapsible sections for asset lists
- Sticky action buttons
- Swipe gestures for accept/reject
- Bottom sheet modals instead of centered

## Edge Cases to Handle

1. **Trade Cancelled While Reviewing**
   - Show message: "This trade has been cancelled by the proposer"
   - Disable all actions

2. **Counter-Offer Chain**
   - Display counter-offer history/thread
   - Clearly mark which trade is active
   - Link to original trade

3. **Commissioner Override**
   - Show override reason/notes
   - Display commissioner who took action
   - Indicate in trade history

4. **Pick Already Traded**
   - Prevent selection in trade composer
   - Show "Already traded to [Team]" tooltip
   - Display trade history on pick

5. **RFA Player Not Owned**
   - Show error: "You don't own the rights to this RFA"
   - Explain RFA trading rules

6. **Protection Becomes Invalid**
   - Swap target pick gets traded
   - Rollover year pick already exists
   - Show error and require reconfiguration

7. **All Teams Accept but Trade Fails Execution**
   - Rare: cap situation changed between acceptance and execution
   - Show error message
   - Revert trade to "accepted" status
   - Notify all teams

## Success Metrics

- Trade creation completion rate
- Time to complete trade (creation ‚Üí execution)
- Trade rejection rate with reasons
- User errors during trade composition
- Mobile vs desktop usage patterns
- Commissioner approval time

## Deliverables

1. **Components**:
   - TradeComposer/Builder
   - TradeInbox/Dashboard
   - TradeReview/DetailView
   - PickProtectionConfig
   - TradeFlowDiagram
   - ValidationFeedback components

2. **Pages/Routes**:
   - `/trades` - Trade inbox
   - `/trades/new` - Create trade
   - `/trades/:id` - Trade details
   - `/trades/:id/counter` - Counter-offer

3. **API Integration**:
   - Service/API layer for all trade endpoints
   - TypeScript types/interfaces for all models
   - Error handling and loading states

4. **Tests**:
   - Component unit tests
   - Integration tests
   - E2E critical path tests

5. **Documentation**:
   - User guide for creating trades
   - User guide for pick protections
   - Developer documentation for components

## Additional Context

**League Settings** (from backend):
```python
LEAGUE_SETTINGS = {
    "SALARY_CAP": 140000000,      # $140M
    "MIN_PLAYER_CAP": 8,          # Minimum 8 players
    "MAX_PLAYER_CAP": 15,         # Maximum 15 players
}
```

**Contract Model** (relevant for RFA logic):
```python
class Contract:
    player: Player
    team: Team
    start_year: int
    duration: int              # 1-4 years
    salary: Decimal
    is_rfa: bool              # Restricted Free Agent
    is_to: bool               # Team Option
```

**Current Year** (for contract year calculations):
- Use `new Date().getFullYear()` or fetch from API
- Years remaining = (start_year + duration) - current_year
- RFA tradeable if: years_remaining <= 0 AND is_rfa = true

## Questions to Clarify with Backend Team

1. Are there rate limits on validation API calls?
2. Is there a WebSocket/SSE endpoint for real-time trade updates?
3. Should draft trades auto-save, or require explicit "Save Draft"?
4. What's the commissioner approval workflow? Auto-approved if no commissioner?
5. Are there any league-specific rules beyond salary/player caps?
6. Can trades be scheduled for future execution?
7. Is there a trade deadline feature?
8. Can picks from future years (e.g., 2027) be traded now?

## Starting Point Recommendations

1. **Phase 1** (MVP):
   - Simple 2-team trades
   - Player-only assets (no picks yet)
   - Basic validation (cap compliance)
   - Accept/reject workflow

2. **Phase 2**:
   - Pick trading (unprotected picks)
   - Multi-team trades (3+ teams)
   - Counter-offers
   - Trade history

3. **Phase 3**:
   - Pick protections (all types)
   - Advanced validation
   - Trade analytics/fairness indicators
   - Commissioner tools

4. **Phase 4**:
   - Mobile optimization
   - Real-time updates
   - Advanced UX features (drag-drop, quick actions)
   - Performance optimizations

Good luck! This is a complex feature with lots of edge cases, but with careful attention to validation, clear UX, and thorough testing, you'll create a robust trading system.
